				<li><h2>Communication Skills</h2></li>
					<P>
						I have learned that whenever there is a problem arising,
						communication seems to be the best tool to use so as to
						overcome and bring along a solution to such a problem. I
						also learned that through the successful completion of 
						Communication and study Skills (CSS 1 & 2) modules during
						my first year.
					</P>
				<li><h2>Leadership Skills</h2></li>
					<P>
						During my first year, second semester, while conducting a 
						Citizenship project, under CSS 2 Module, I led the team 
						which helped and assisted the large number of students from
						Makola High School know more about drug abuse as well as the
						consequences of drug abuse amongst students and youth. During
						the course of that project i was able to negotiate proposals and
						resources that contributed to successful completion of that project.

				<li><h2>Team Work Skills</h2></li>
					<P>
						More than all other important things, team work is also 
						considered to be the key to success as it brings along 
						good relationship amongst team members and the society.
						Therefore I am able to work along with people of various
						personalities which I aquired at School, from community as 
						well as from the voluntary Citizenship Project conducted as 
						already stated above.
